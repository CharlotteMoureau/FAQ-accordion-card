# FAQ-accordion-card

This is a solo project started on the 12th of February 2021. I chose the ["faq accordion card"](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam/hub/faq-accordion-card-9uwjLqOjs) exercise on the (Frontend Mentor)[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website. The website provided me with various assets including JPG images of the design files and a basic style guide. There's also a README to help me get started.

## Rules:

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The user should be able to :

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Bonus: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript

## The result expected:

Desktop:

Mobile:

## My method

I chose to use Sass and to give Javascript a go. I am going for a mobile-first approach.
